# TEC
TEC (Transformation Electromagnetics Code) solves for the material parameters called for by various transformation optics (TO) devices.
There are two different sourec files found here thus far, along with a number of sample surfaces and sample volumes.  The first: TEC_2D can be used to create anisotropic surface wave cloaks and illusion devices using any of the structured meshes found in \Sample_surfaces.  The second: TEC_3D is a very basic code which effectively compares elemental volumes of a virtual and physical space in an attempt to test a Volumetric quasi-conformal transformation optics (VQCTO) technique.  The meshed volumes that TEC_3D operates on can be found in \Sample_volumes.
